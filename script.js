// Task 1: Change the cloud to stop the rain
// 1. Create a variable "cloud" that stores the element "cloud"

// 2. Change the src from "rain-cloud1" to "cloud1"

// 2. Change the value of display to "flex" to make the rainbow appear


//Task 3: Change the color of the outer arch to red
// 1. Create a variable called "arches" that will store all the arches in a rainbow
// Use getElementsByClassName(); to make an array of all values that have the class arch
// These elements are stored in the order they are seen from top to bottom

// 2. Change the color of the first arch in ""
// You can associate each letter of ROYGBIV to an index of the array
// Remember that arrays start counting at zero so R(red) is 


// Task 4: Add missing violet arch

// 2. Give it both classes: 'arch' for shape and 'violet' for color

// 3. Add to rainbow
